      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have an opinion about whether trans women are real women, any more than I have an estimate of the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin, a belief about the mood of Thursday, or an opinion on whether colourless green ideas do in fact sleep furiously</description>

      <description>There is a strange kind of intellectual myopia that academics are vulnerable to whenever the subject of transgender rights comes up. People who might under normal circumstances speak in a careful and measured fashion suddenly become prone to wild exaggeration and reckless generalisations. I am genuinely baffled as to why this happens, but I have some hypotheses.</description>

      <description>A long piece on transgender rights, in which I admit that I do have opinions on what social and political considerations a person such as myself deserves. The central claim is that transgender rights can be justified on their own terms, pragmatically, without requiring any recourse to strong metaphysical claims about the nature of gender identity.</description>
