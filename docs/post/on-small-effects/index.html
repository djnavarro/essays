<p>There is a strange kind of intellectual panic that academics are vulnerable to, whenever the subject of transgender rights comes up. People who might under normal circumstances speak in a careful and measured fashion suddenly become prone to wild exaggeration and reckless generalisations. I am genuinely baffled as to why this happens, but I have some hypotheses.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>An email appeared in my work inbox this afternoon, forwarding <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/few-female-engineers-its-a-matter-of-choice/news-story/5c9a4d58ddf7656a0920d597d413339b">an article</a> published in <em>The Australian</em> newspaper. The authors are academics and they self-identify as Madeleine Beekman, a “professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Sydney”, and Bill von Hippel, a “professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Queensland”. The article begins with this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Australian Academy of Sciences recently changed its definition of a woman. According to the new definition, anyone who identifies as a woman is a woman, regardless of their biological sex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this passage refers to is the fact that AAS recently announced a policy of classifying transgender women such as myself as women for administrative purposes, rather than as men as we would traditionally have been treated. It goes on to acknowledge that this is a good thing to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This definition has the clear advantage that people who don’t identify with their biological sex will now be recognised as their preferred gender, an obvious social justice issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Oh how nice”, I think to myself. Then I read the next sentence and my heart sinks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, with this new definition of woman, the academy is tacitly stating that biological sex is of no significance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article then pivots away from transgender women entirely. The vast majority of the piece has <em>nothing at all</em> to do with transgender people. Instead it focuses on whether there are meaningful biological sex differences between cisgender men and women that might explain the observed gender disparities in STEM disciplines.</p>
<p>Oooookay.</p>
<p>As a scientist as well as a transgender woman, I confess that I am puzzled (and more than a little annoyed) by that last sentence. Allow me to repeat it with emphasis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, with this new definition of woman, the academy is tacitly stating that <strong>biological sex is of no significance</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is patently absurd, and if I hadn’t seen this kind of ridiculous exaggeration from academics so very many times before I would be surprised that intelligent people would make this error. When I point out that this is an utterly unreasonable thing to say, I am met with a kind of blank surprise and defensiveness so complete that I don’t know how to address it. Cisgender academics appear to be genuinely shocked that I would say this. They literally cannot understand what that sentence is a nonsense.</p>
<p>So I suppose I had best explain why it is a nonsense. I wish I did not have to. I am very, very tired of this silliness.</p>
<p align="center">
::::
</p>
<p>Let us start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Suppose for the moment that AAS had not adopted a trans-inclusive definition. Suppose they had decided to exclude transgender women, and treat “woman” as a purely biological category. As scientists perhaps they might have chosen to define “woman” in chromosomal terms: people with XX chromosomes are deemed women for administrative purposes and people with XY chromosomes are deemed men. This definition mostly (but not completely) agrees with our everyday concept of “men and women”. Biology – like any complex system – is somewhat messy, and a small proportion of the populace are intersex, and their identities are less easy to classify using this kind of simplistic rule.</p>
<p>Even so, there aren’t very many intersex people (about 1-2% of the population), so a simplistic biological approach that assigned people to categories based on (say) chromosomes would maybe be about 98% accurate. That’s actually a pretty decent classification rate and in most classification contexts we’d probably be happy to classify anything with that kind of success rate.</p>
<p>However, because we are not jerks we recognise that a little care is needed. The rights of of intersex persons are <em>important</em> so rather than rigidly insisting on a too-simple rule we aim to be flexible. In most circumstances our approach is to allow intersex people to be treated as members of the category they feel is most appropriate. It is rare for academics who believe in biological sex categories to start wringing their hands and boldly proclaim that the words “man” and “woman” have fundamentally changed their definition merely because intersex people exist and are given reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p>Why, that would be <em>absurd</em>.</p>
<p>The existence and recognition of a tiny minority does not suddenly render the ordinary biological categories “of no significance”, now does it? Only a shallow and overly rigid thinker would make such a silly error.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Dear reader, you are not foolish and I know that you can see where I’m going with this, but please bear with me as I do so.</p>
<p align="center">
::::
</p>
<p>Suppose we now consider what happens when we adopt a trans-inclusive definition of gender categories, as the AAS has done. Transgender people are also a very small minority. Estimates vary, but 1% is probably a reasonable number. Even with the recent destigmatisation of transgender people, very few people who were assigned male at birth will choose to live as a woman. Very few people assigned female at birth choose to live as a man. Some people choose to reject both categories and identify as nonbinary, but again their numbers are few.</p>
<p>In other words, by adopting a trans-inclusive definition, the accuracy of our chromosome based classifier might decrease from 98% to 97%. If biological (chromosomal) sex was deemed “essential” when it was 98%, why is it suddenly “of no significance” when we adopt a definition that shrinks the accuracy to 97%.</p>
<p>Why, that would be <em>absurd</em>.</p>
<p>When framed in terms of the empirical base rates of intersex and transgender people, the scientific illiteracy of Beekman and von Hippel’s claim is painfully clear. From a “cold hard facts” perspective it makes no sense whatsoever to assert one definition ignores the reality of biological sex and the other does not. When the practical differences between the two approaches are so tiny, it simply can’t be so.</p>
<p align="center">
::::
</p>
<p>Given the strangeness of this error it becomes pertinent to ask: why do smart people make such foolish mistakes? I have several hypotheses, none of which I’ve ever been able to confirm or falsify very well.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis might be called the <em>blind spot theory</em>. According to this hypothesis, this kind of thing occurs due to a kind of thoughtlessness or cognitive myopia. That is, because transgender people are so rare and our experiences are so very different to those of cisgender people, cisgender people aren’t very skilled at thinking about the entailments of their claims. Put crudely, the claim is that cisgender people simply do not think about us at all.</p>
<p>How would the “blind spot” hypothesis work in this scenario? According to the theory, what happens here is that cisgender people look at the AAS definition and think something like this: “well <em>anyone</em> might self-identify as a woman with no consequences, and if that were to happen there would be no relationship between sex and gender at all!”</p>
<p>The silliness of this reasoning is painfully obvious to every transgender person: there are <em>consequences</em> to being trans, and those consequences are very significant indeed. Even without looking at the (dire) statistics on transgender lives, it should be obvious to anyone that there are massive disadvantages to being trans. Compared to most, I am very lucky, but even for me it is grim: I regularly receive abusive comments on social media, I have been threatened with violence for being trans, and I live in constant fear that my basic rights will be taken away from me for no reason other than naked partisan gain by cynical politicians.</p>
<p>So when say that I “identify as a woman”, it most certainly means something substantial. It doesn’t mean that on a whim I decided to throw on a dress one day (and in point of fact I don’t wear dresses very often). What it has actually meant for me is that over the last four years I have</p>
<ul>
<li>been diagnosed with gender dysphoria</li>
<li>taken hormone replacement therapy and, as a consequence</li>
<li>grown breasts</li>
<li>had my facial hair removed in an extremely painful way</li>
<li>changed my name legally</li>
<li>changed many many id documents and been repeatedly humiliated and verbally abused on occasions when doing so</li>
<li>et cetera et cetera.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every transgender person will do these things. We vary quite a lot. But for every transgender person there <em>are</em> substantial consequences and in most cases the practical result is that bad things happen to us. In the world we actually live in, there are very few people who even <em>want</em> to transition, and fewer still who take any substantial steps towards doing so.</p>
<p>In other words, when we examine the practical consequences of the AAS definition in the real world, the idea that “anyone could identify as anything” doesn’t really hold up. Unfortunately, in order to see that the idea is silly, you actually have to think this through. For transgender people this is trivially easy: we can look at our lives and it just “pops out” at us. But for cisgender people it’s not so obvious. The have this blind spot that prevents them from seeing how absurd a claim this is. That’s the first hypothesis.</p>
<p align="center">
::::
</p>
<p>The second hypothesis I have that might explain the phenomenon is one that every academic will find very familiar: <em>pedantry</em>. Academics are notorious sticklers for “the principle of the thing”, are prone to dig in when we believe ourselves to be “technically correct” and so on. The pedantry account is subtly different to the blind spot account. According to the blind spot idea, cisgender people simply fail to think about the real world consequences of their ideas. According to the pedantry account, in contrast, they consider these consequences but claim that they are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Here’s how that account would work in this scenario. From a practical standpoint – given the world we live in – there is very little difference in how the AAS definition and the traditional one <em>behave</em>. They classify people into gender categories in an almost identical fashion, with a mere 1% (give or take) of people making up the discrepancy. But to the pedant, this is not important. To the pedant it is the principle of the thing that matters, and according to (their choice of) principles there is actually a difference between the two rules. Specifically, the traditional definition <em>explicitly</em> links gender categories to biological sex whereas the AAS defintion connects sex and gender in an <em>implicit</em> way only. In our world as it exists these two rules are almost indistinguishable in practice (though transgender people such as myself have the misfortune to be that 1% of disputed cases). But! But, the pedant exclaims, if the base rates were different then the two rules would behave very differently. If we lived in a world where 40% of people were transgender then there would be quite marked practical differences. Ergo, we must treat this as a matter of importance!</p>
<p>The funny thing is, as a transgender woman who has become incredibly tired of the whole thing, the kind of person who makes this argument also tends to fancy themselves a hard nosed scientists. “Facts don’t care about your feelings!” they declare, when dismissing the concerns of transgender people. It is puzzling however, because if scientific facts don’t care about feelings, then the actual base rate of transgender people as it exists in this world is also a fact. In the real world, it is a distinction that makes little difference to anyone <em>except</em> transgender people. Under the AAS definition our lives are better than under the traditional one. For everyone else, life continues as before.</p>
<p>It is a weirdly cruel hill to die on.</p>
<p align="center">
::::
</p>
<p>My third hypothesis for this phenomenon might be called the <em>clickbait</em> hypothesis. According to this view, what is happening here is that the authors simply don’t care one way or the other about transgender lives. They actually want to talk about something else, in this case sex differences as they pertain to the (mostly cisgender) human population. However, this subject is … well, it’s kind of boring. It doesn’t exactly get people excited. So, because editors like to sell papers and academics love an eager audience, what the article needs is a cute or dramatic anecdote to “suck the reader in”. In other words, perhaps those paragraphs about transgender people weren’t meant to be taken seriously, they were just meant as “rhetorical flourish”.</p>
<p>What puzzles me about this one is that when I suggest this as a possible explanation, cisgender people jump at it. “Yes, yes!” they say “don’t take it seriously”. They breathe a sigh of relief, thankful that there is no cause for alarm.</p>
<p>They say this and I think… “But that’s actually <em>worse</em>. You do know that this makes it worse, right?” Under the blind spot hypothesis, the behaviour is accidental. We all have blind spots, and it is not hard to have sympathy in this case. Under the pedantry hypothesis, the behaviour is intentional but still slightly excusable. We all have our moments of pedantry. But the clickbait hypothesis postulates that the writer knows perfectly well that their claims are unfair and somewhat cruel to transgender people, but they have <em>deliberately</em> concluded that it is justifiable for them to be unkind to us, if the result is that they get a few more clicks on their article. That is immoral and selfish.</p>
<p align="center">
::::
</p>
<p>There is one last hypothesis that I have. One I hope is not true. A hypothesis of last resort if you will. Sometimes people are hurtful towards transgender folks not out of blindness, not out of misguided pedantry, not even out of selfishness.</p>
<p>Sometimes they do it out of malice.</p>
