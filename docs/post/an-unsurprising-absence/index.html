<p>There is question circulating twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/historyofarmani/status/1290484329580130306">what radicalised you?</a></p>
<p>Up until a few years ago I’d have said nothing had, that I’m not a radical. Like many of my academic peers I would have thought of myself as a typical middle class progressive. I supported progressive causes, would sometimes donate to fundraisers, and so on. I was (and am) a member of my union, I voted Greens locally and Labor federally, I didn’t cross picket lines et cetera. I’d politely express my political disagreements with my more conservative acquaintances, try to convince them of my point of view (occasionally even successfully!) and generally behaved like a good, respectable progressive.</p>
<p>This changed when I transitioned. At first I tried to play the part of <a href="https://djnavarro.net/post/in-between%22">“the good tran”</a>, the nice respectable trans woman who doesn’t make waves and doesn’t make her fellow middle class progressives uncomfortable. I thought that made sense strategically: my academic peers would see that I am just like them, and if I needed their support on something they would be willing to extend it.</p>
<p>In retrospect this seems laughably naive of me: academics are the <em>worst</em> allies a trans woman could possibly have.</p>

</p>
<p>To many this might seem strange. Doesn’t academia have this reputation of being extremely progressive and far-left? Isn’t it true that there are fewer conservatives on campus than progressives? Well yes, actually, it is. But academic progressives are mostly milquetoast, timid people with little courage. They are very good at waving the rainbow flag and reciting meaningless slogans, but very poor at doing anything more than that. For four years I have tried to convince my academic colleagues that supporting transgender people means something more than mumbling some nice words, tweeting the occasional news article, and then going back to writing grant applications. For four years I have failed at this.</p>
<p>For a while I thought that the problem was simply a lack of understanding. Perhaps, I told myself, that my colleagues and peers simply did not understand what life is like for trans women. Perhaps this lack of understanding is the reason why it has been almost impossible to convince them to take action. So I have written <a href="https://djnavarro.net/post/in-between">post</a> <a href="/post/52-pickup/">after</a> <a href="/post/an-ordinary-account/">post</a> <a href="/post/never-the-same/">after</a> <a href="/post/on-small-differences/">post</a> <a href="/post/a-lexical-decision/">after</a> <a href="/post/a-subjective-impression">post</a> on my own blog. I have engaged on twitter, on other academic blogs and forums. I have participated in ally training at universities, agreed to be a speaker at workshops, and so on. None of it has made a dent in the wall of apparent indifference that I encounter whenever the next thing happens. Every time it is the same. I literally beg people – academics with immaculate progressive credentials – for their support, and they remain silent.</p>
<p>I thought perhaps it was a lack of perceived solidarity with other marginalised people on my part. Perhaps cisgender women did not support me because I did not speak out enough about the misogyny they face. Perhaps gay people remained silent because I did not talk about homophobia. Perhaps Black people remained silent because I was not active enough in my attempts to be anti-racist. I put more effort in on all those areas, not solely in the hope of observing some reciprocity but also because they are inherently valuable efforts. The results of my effort: nothing. Women remained silent. Gay people remained silent. Black people remained silent. For four years. Nothing.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been contemplating a different possible explanation. Perhaps the problem is that the people I have been asking for support are <em>academics</em>. Perhaps, contrary to their stated politics, academics are not particularly progressive people. Perhaps they are too timid, too comfortable, too complacent to support trans women. After all, I note with some weariness, transgender rights have become a highly political topic. Conservative academics and anti-trans feminist academics have shown no hesitation in joining the fray. They hardly ever shut up about the bloody topic. But the “progressives” show no similar engagement. The reason, I think, is that they aren’t in fact very progressive. Transgender rights, and especially trans women’s rights, have become a political battleground, but within academia only one side is really fighting. The progressives are just milling around, standing off to the side and assuming that somehow “the right side of history” will prevail without them having to lift a finger.</p>
<p>They are, simply put, useless.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Even when it comes to the most basic of things I have been shocked at the uselessness of academics. I’ve watched in despair as people I once called my friends happily chitchat with people who have publicly harassed me, belittled me and mocked me. When I’ve literally begged people not turn my life into a public debate, set aside all pretense at dignity in order to ask for a modicum of kindness, they have gone right ahead and done exactly the thing I asked them not to. If I cannot rely on you for political support, and I cannot rely on you to act like my friends, I have to ask: what good are you?</p>
<p>It is not all bad though. Where my fellow tenured academics have proven themselves to be worthless allies, others have not. People I know through the tech industry have been willing to speak up. People I know through the sex work community have been willing to speak up. Graduate students and adjuncts have been willing to stand up. As a consequence I find myself spending more of my time with people who show a willingness to support trans women, and trying to learn more about how to be better allies to them. It is perhaps petty of me but I have reached the level of cynicism at which I’ve lost any real desire to help or support people who are unwilling to show even the slightest bit of reciprocity. In that respect tenured academics, uniquely among every social group I have encountered that tends toward left-of-centre politics, are completely and irredeemably <em>useless</em>.</p>
<p>So what radicalised me? Academics.</p>
