      <description>I am haunted by a pedestrian phrase. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re still the same person&amp;rdquo;, I am told. It is a phrase offered with kindness, as a reassurance of sorts, usually on those occasions when the subject of my gender transition arises. It&amp;rsquo;s an expression of support. How you appear to the outside world may have changed, my interlocutor concedes, but on the inside you&amp;rsquo;re still the same person I&amp;rsquo;ve always known and liked all these years. The unspoken implication hangs in the air: things will remain the same. [DRAFT POST]</description>
