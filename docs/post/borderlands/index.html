<p>[work in progress – please do not share]</p>
<p>Last week the desire to hurt myself got so bad I took myself to the emergency room at the RPA hospital. It was a bit of a surreal experience, I’ll admit, but on the whole I got through it okay. The staff were kind and professional, I didn’t encounter any transphobia (yay!) and because I took the right course of action for once I’m recovering from it quite rapidly. The last time things got this bad, a little over a year ago, I didn’t take any sensible precautions, hurt myself rather more severely than I ever had in the past, and was off work for several months dealing with the fallout. This time around I’ve only had to take a few days off. I’m not at 100% capacity, but I’m getting something one. Strange as it might sound given the severity of the event, I’m proud of myself for not fucking it up as badly as I might have done in the past.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had my follow up appointment with the clinical psychologist – the NSW health service is quite sensible about these things and has mechanisms to monitor and assist people after an acute incident like this. It went well, actually. We talked quite frankly about my situation for about an hour, about the various strategies I have in place to cope when these things happen, and to my pleasant surprise he agreed I was doing the right things. Yay me!</p>
<p>There were a few surprises though. One of them that I’ve been pondering all day is the possibility – which he brought up rather obliquely – that treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) might be of value to me.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Okay, I’ll admit that one stings a little. I’m getting rather tired of accruing mental illness diagnoses. Mental health is not a fucking stamp collection, and the goal of the bloody exercise is to get rid of the problems not add new ones to the list. Sheesh. I mean, if we stipulate that the psychologist is correct, my list of conditions is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>gender dysphoria (duh!)</li>
<li>depression (severe)</li>
<li>generalised anxiety (moderate/severe)</li>
<li>PTSD (moderate/severe)</li>
<li>BPD</li>
</ul>
<p>Thrilling. I can barely contain myself with joy.</p>
<p align="center">
****
</p>
<p>Looking honestly at this list of diagnoses, I’d say the accuracy of the first three is beyond contest. Pretty hard to argue I don’t have gender dysphoria, for example! It takes about 20 seconds of honest self reflection to admit that these are all accurate. The PTSD and BPD diagnoses, on the other hand, I have mixed feelings about.</p>
<p>My reticence to accept the PTSD diagnosis is pretty straightforward: I don’t really acknowledge that my ostensible rape trauma is real or legitimate. You can’t have PTSD if nothing bad ever happened to you, after all. So if I am unwilling to concede that what happened to me actually counts as “real rape”, then I’m not really a survivor, and therefore – all those flashbacks to the contrary – people are full of shit when they tell me I have PTSD. I’ll concede that I’m probably wrong on this point, but at an emotional level I don’t really believe that my supposed rape-induced PTSD is legitimate. My therapist has been mildly irritated at me on this point for some time now.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>The BPD diagnosis makes me even more uncomfortable, but the reasons are a little different. In part I’m being petty: it annoys me that my ex was right, and frankly I’m a bit irritated at him for that. But there’s more than that. The stereotype about people with BPD is that they (we?) are manipulative, irrational, insecure, and unstable. See? Danielle really <em>is</em> that crazy bitch ex-girlfriend that no-one should go believe! It’s a medical fact!</p>
<p>Well, kind of.</p>
<p>The point is that it’s something that undermines people’s trust in you – in a he says/she says scenario who should you believe, the respectable man or his borderline ex-girlfriend?</p>
<p>BPD is a credibility-killer. All else being equal, we believe the person without BPD over the person with BPD. The same isn’t true for depression, anxiety, or even PTSD. As far as I can tell people don’t consider me less credible by virtue of having these mental health conditions. But I fear a BPD diagnosis for the same reason I feared the gender dysphoria diagnosis:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> it gives people an excuse not to take me seriously. If I do have BPD and I publicly acknowledge it, anyone and everyone will have a reason to dismiss my emotions as irrational or an overreaction no matter what the context may be, and for the life of me I cannot think of a way that I could contest such a claim.</p>
<p>That terrifies me.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p align="center">
****
</p>
<p>Even so, there is little point in hiding from one’s fears. If it is true then it is true, and I’d be better served by facing up to it than trying to pretend it isn’t a problem. Because I don’t exactly trust my intuitions, I took an unimaginative psychometric approach and rand myself through bunch of tests for various conditions, trying to answer questions as honestly as I possibly could.</p>
<p>The results? Well the good news is that I don’t have an eating disorder, I don’t have ADHD, and I’m not on the autism spectrum. No surprises there. Equally unsurprising is that the questionnaire result suggests that my depression is extremely bad: I scored quite a long way above the cutoff score for severe depression. Duh. The assessed anxiety score placed me on the border between moderate and severe (which sounds about right to me), and so did my PTSD score.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> All of this checks out, and agrees with the other sources of evidence I have available to me. Of course that’s all just a calibration check – if I’d gotten any other result for those I’d be deeply dubious about any BPD result. So how did the BPD test go?</p>
<p>My score placed me in the “severe BPD” category.</p>
<p>Y i k e s.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>It’s going to be a while before I’m really able to make sense of this. One thing that confuses me a little about it is that in <em>most</em> contexts my BPD – stipulating for the moment that the test is accurate – doesn’t show. As far as I know most people who know me in real life would agree that I am an emotional person but would also consider a BPD diagnosis pretty implausible. I brought up the possibility with my therapist once before and he just laughed. Why? He knows me <em>very</em> well, he’s good at his job to the point of having been right about basically everything else (annoying bastard) so how did he get this one wrong? Why doesn’t he see it?</p>
<p>My best guess is that there’s a mismatch between how I feel and how I behave. My emotional temperament really is wild – I have extreme emotional reactions to things, I have huge issues around attachment and abandonment, and is massively effortful for me to self soothe, tamp down the emotion etc. That is grossly typical of BPD, I’m told, and every romantic partner I’ve had has observed this pattern.</p>
<p>What I don’t have, apparently – and indeed have rarely been accused of, even by my exes who have no particular reason to be nice to me – is a pattern of being manipulative. I work pretty hard to make sure I don’t use my emotions as weapons in a relationship, and I don’t believe my emotions are a justification for expressing anger or hostility towards my partner, so I don’t do that. In fact what often happens behaviourally in these situations is that I overcompensate, slowing down everything I do, suppressing all emotion in my voice and so on. While I have all the usual BPD-style emotional issues around attachment and insecurity, I know my partner and myself pretty well and I can tell when my emotions have gone haywire. The objective evidence is that my partner doesn’t lie to me about these things, even in situations where a comforting lie might be nice. That makes it a lot easier for me to reject the miscalibrated emotion, thankfully. For the most part I compensate for the BPD symptoms surprisingly well, to the point that even people who know me well in real life would find it a surprise.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>I can think of some exceptions.</p>
<p>A notable one is email. A lot of people send very terse, emotionally neutral emails (which is totally fine of course!) that have a tendency to cause me problems. Over time I’ve learned purely by force of effort that someone who sends a terse email is not in fact telling me that they despise me, but yeah actually it does take me some effort not to spiral into anxiety, each and every time.</p>
<p>The worst one, however, is twitter. Viewed from the perspective of my putative BPD diagnosis, twitter is an unremitting clusterfuck. Emotions run high sometimes, people are genuinely malicious at times, and the communications are so brief. Even for someone without BPD it is difficult to tell the difference between trolls and someone with a sincere question. This is all made worse by the fact that so much of the conversation is conducted with dogwhistles, dunks and subtweets. It is objectively a difficult problem to solve, I suspect, and it is made so much worse when one is prone to wildly exaggerated and difficult-to-manage emotion<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> … do I even have to explain this one to anyone who has seen my twitter feed????</p>
<p>I don’t handle twitter at all well. There is, after all, a reason I wrote a whole post on my thoughts on how to <a href="/post/surviving-twitter">survive twitter</a>: it’s something I’ve struggled with a lot, and I’m starting to get a better understanding of why that is.</p>
<p align="center">
****
</p>
<p>All this brings me to the practical question I need to solve. For the most part my BPD (or whatever) is currently being managed quite effectively in real life and especially in my intimate relationships, but it’s emphatically <em>not</em> under control in regards to social media. This cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the right answer to this one is, I’ll admit. I think a lot of the things I wrote in the “surviving twitter” post are a good beginning, but I think there’s some potential improvements I can make in light of this BPD perspective. In real life my strategy of “slow it the fuck down and shut out all outward emotional expression until my inner turmoil subsides” is actually super effective (exhausting as fuck, but effective). The “shut out the emotion” part prevents me from saying or doing something that would lead to more emotional responses from others, and the “slow down” part is a kind of flattening-the-curve action. It gives me time to cope with each wave of emotion before the next one hits. It actually works.</p>
<p>Twitter, however, makes this almost impossible for me. I have too many followers at this point, and if I tweet about something emotional I will either get too many responses (each setting off emotions that then become flooding) or else I get too few (which makes me think that everyone is ignoring me or abandoning me or whatever). Either one is a BPD nightmare. So what is the solution? Currently I’m thinking a two part strategy might be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I think the analog to “shut out the emotion” is “avoid certain topics”. No more talking about anything transgender. Do not interact with anyone on politics, do not get involved in any discussion where other people are already emotional. It cannot and will not go well for me if I do.</p></li>
<li><p>The analog to “slow down” is “enforced log out”. If I don’t have access to my account I can’t tweet. Fewer tweets, further apart, and less doomscrolling. To that end I’ve changed the recovery email on my account to my partner’s address, had her change the password, and I log out after I tweet. I’ve been trying this for a few days (ever since the unpleasant events of last week) and it does seem to be helping.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Early days, and it’s all a work in progress. Fingers crossed, I suppose.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I’ve committed myself to not discussing trans topics in public anymore, but suffice it to say that my experience as a transgender woman has been deeply humiliating in that sense. Being transgender – and especially being a trans woman – is considered prima facie evidence that a person is not to be considered credible. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>And of course my first thought when I acknowledge this fear is, gosh how easy it would be for someone else to dismiss my fear of a BPD diagnosis as a BPD symptom… <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Fine. Whatever. I have PTSD. Can we drop the fucking subject now? <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Do not place me in charge of the launch codes. Seriously people. I make a decent editor or reviewer because science is mostly boring and I take care to recuse myself from certain topics, but do not put me in charge of people management or anything that requires emotional stability, for the love of all that is rational in this world. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
