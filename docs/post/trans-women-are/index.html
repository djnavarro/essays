<p>[work in progress – please do not share]</p>
<p>It is probably not difficult to infer that I dislike the phrase “trans women are women”. In my post on <a href="/post/an-ordinary-account">transgender rights</a>, I took care to outline my opinions in a way that makes no reference to <em>any</em> claim about whether I am a “real woman”. I have been consistent on this point for a long time: I do not think that the case for transgender rights rests on any such claim, so I do not and will not include it in any argument I make regarding the rights of transgender people.</p>
<p>Similarly when I wrote my post on why I <a href="/post/a-lexical-decision">describe myself as a trans woman</a> and at times simply as a woman, I did not justify myself by making any claim about being a “real” woman. Even if my gender identity were a total fiction, in most cases we don’t usually have a problem with calling fictional women “women” even though we would agree they are not real women. My willingness to use the word is not dependent on any strong metaphysical stance.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>Nevertheless people do sometimes ask my opinions about this topic.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>So, what do you think about the phrase “trans women are women” and do you agree with it?</p>
<p><strong>I strongly feel this question is ambiguous and I am not going to endorse any claim one way or another unless you are more precise. As stated the question is no more meaningful than asking how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. It doesn’t have an answer.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are several possible ways you can make the question precise, and my answers are different in each case:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do you think trans women should be treated as women in situations where it is practical to do so?</p>
<p><strong>Yes, absolutely.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do you believe that facts related to sex and reproductive biology are unimportant or irrelevant when we discuss women?</p>
<p><strong>No, absolutely not.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do you believe that verbally stated claims about gender have any direct causal relationship to biological facts about women?</p>
<p><strong>Except in the trivial sense that everything about us is biological, no.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do you support your trans sisters in their/our political fight for civil rights?</p>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do you think there is a meaningful scientific/statistical difference between people with XX chromosomes and people with XY chromosomes?</p>
<p><strong>Yes. Duh.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do you endorse the claim that “trans women are biologically male [or biologically female]”?</p>
<p><strong>I think this question is a trap: I am yet to see an example where this version of the question has been used in good faith rather than as a deliberate attempt to antagonise trans women.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do you think that “being a woman” is a psychological state, solely a function of a person’s feelings and sense of personal identity?</p>
<p><strong>No. Laws, social norms and biology are relevant.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do you believe that trans women are “real women” in some deep metaphysical sense?</p>
<p><strong>Good grief, who cares?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am not a philosopher and have no desire to be. I don’t know, I don’t care, and I refuse to devote my limited time and effort to this question until cisgender people devote their time and effort to things that actually matter like transgender homelessness. As far as I am concerned the metaphysics of gender is a massive distraction and I deeply resent the fact that this is a “thing”. Come back to me when I have time to waste on pointless questions like this.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps. Please never ask me this absurd question again.</p>
