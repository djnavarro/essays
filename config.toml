  about = "Miscellaneous writings by [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net). This site is more a personal journal than anything else. Sometimes I write 'essays' in the sense of short pieces of writing on a specific subjects, but more often my posts are 'essays' in the sense that they are tries or attempts at something. Not everything I write here should be regarded as serious opinion, and should not be taken to be me speaking in any professional capacity. Often the things I write here are attempts to organise or make sense of raw emotion, and ought not be read as more than that."
