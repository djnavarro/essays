This site is a personal journal, and nothing I write here should be viewed as a professional opinion. Often the things I write here are attempts to organise or make sense of raw emotions, and ought not be read as more than that. Sometimes I write 'essays' in the sense of being short pieces of writing on a specific subjects, but often my posts are 'essays' in the sense that they are tries or attempts at something.

The posts themselves are [here](/post/).
