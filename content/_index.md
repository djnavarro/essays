An important note. This site is a personal journal, and nothing I write here should be construed as a professional opinion. Often the things I write here are attempts to organise or make sense of my own emotions, and ought not be read as more than that. They are not intended as serious or substantive writings: sometimes I write "essays" in the sense of that they are short pieces of writing on a specific subjects, but more often my posts are "essays" in the sense that they are tries or attempts at something, and may not be very well thought through. With that as forewarning, the posts themselves are [here](/post/).
