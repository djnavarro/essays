<p>Once upon a time, in a different life to this, I had the misfortune to discover something that my ex-boyfriend had written about me. It wasn’t directed at me, it didn’t refer to me by name or in any way that anyone except a few close friends could recognise as me, and I only came across it by blind chance. But it was public, and a lot of people saw it.</p>
<p>Reading it was a surreal experience, a strange reflection of the relationship I remember. A few of the things he wrote about me were entirely true, others were absolutely not. But most things were, I think, simply unfair. There were passages where I know he omitted relevant information, other passages where I think we never saw eye to eye in the first place.</p>
<p>Some of it I could have sworn were designed to play upon my worst fears about myself. There were passages that seemed perfectly crafted to hurt me in ways that only someone who knew me well would know how to pull off. So well crafted that I wondered if I was meant to see it. Or so perfectly on point that maybe they just had to be true. Or any one of a thousand other feverish possibilities that went through my mind over and over for months afterwards. Even to this day I don’t know if he did it deliberately. I suspect he didn’t. But it doesn’t matter. The damage was done and it took me years to get over.</p>

<p>I thought about my ex-lover’s description of me of a couple of weeks go – for the first time in years – when JK Rowling published her now-infamous essay<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> describing her opinions on transgender rights. I’d been waiting for something like this. We all knew it was coming, and we all knew it would be bad. It took me a while to work up the courage to read her post, and I’ve been feeling hurt and angry about it ever since.</p>
<p>The thing I am struck by reading it is how similar my feelings are about the two incidents. Rowling’s essay reads like a collection of half-truths about transgender lives and experiences. Like seeing your own life reflected back at you in the most bizarrely distorted form.</p>
<p>Much like the former lover’s recitation, there are things in there I cannot respond to in good conscience except in the most general of terms. Where my ex wrote about personal details, Rowling writes about academic ones. She cites statistics that pertain to the rates of persistence and desistence of gender dysphoria among children, and she cites recent research published by Lisa Littman about apparent rapid-onset gender dysphoria. As it happens I have read the relevant literature and I do have thoughts. Yet I ought not say too much because they are “almost” within my professional area of expertise. I don’t have quite enough knowledge about them to be able to speak to them with my professional hat on, but my academic discipline is close enough that if I offered any strong opinion it would seem as if I were claiming expertise that I don’t actually possess. Ethically, I don’t think I can justify any stronger statement than to say it is my personal opinion that Rowling mischaracterises the evidence.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>It feels unsatisfying and a little bit pathetic, like protesting my ex-boyfriend’s letter by saying “it’s not fair”. It’s a child’s response, and it’s a little demoralising to realise that’s the corner you’ve been backed into.</p>

<p>Toward the end, there’s a section in Rowling’s essay talking about her personal experiences with violence and abuse. It’s deeply personal and by far the hardest part of the essay to read. The part that sent shivers down my spine is this one. If you’ve ever been the victim of sexual violence you <em>know</em> that she’s not lying.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This part is absolutely the truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scars left by violence and sexual assault don’t disappear, no matter how loved you are, and no matter how much money you’ve made. My perennial jumpiness is a family joke – and even I know it’s funny – but I pray my daughters never have the same reasons I do for hating sudden loud noises, or finding people behind me when I haven’t heard them approaching.</p>
<p>If you could come inside my head and understand what I feel when I read about a trans woman dying at the hands of a violent man, you’d find solidarity and kinship. I have a visceral sense of the terror in which those trans women will have spent their last seconds on earth, because I too have known moments of blind fear when I realised that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky self-restraint of my attacker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a few small edits to reflect the particulars of my own rape trauma, I could have written these paragraphs. The exaggerated startle reflex, the terror over specific things that remind you of what happened, that blind fear at your own helplessness. How bitterly familiar this sounds. In this cannot help but feel the same sympathy and kinship for Rowling that she describes feeling towards trans women. As strange as it might sound coming from me as a trans woman, I believe her because I feel the same toward her.</p>
<p>Rowling and I are on different sides of the exhausting dispute about the rights of transgender people,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> but I can’t make myself abandon any survivor of sexual violence. She may be my political opponent in one respect and a dangerously influential one at that; but in another respect that matters to me no less deeply I cannot do anything but support her.</p>
<p>It is a peculiar position to occupy.</p>

</p>
<p>There were passages in my ex-boyfriend’s writing that made me question my own sanity. Parts where he imputed all kinds of mental illnesses to me (I sometimes wonder if I have ever had an ex-boyfriend who didn’t), parts where he told just enough of the story to make me look like a terrible person. I asked myself over and over if he was right: maybe this person he is describing is really me. The person he describes is so disturbed that they would not even realise how badly disturbed they are. If he’s right about me, I would never know it. I would be the unreliable narrator of my own life story.</p>
<p>There are parts of Rowling’s post that confuse me in a similar way. After telling her story of sexual abuse, she pivots to a passage that is completely beyond my ability to understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he’s a woman – and, as I’ve said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones – then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Is</em> this the simple truth?</p>
<p>As it happens I am exactly the person she seems to fear: the legislative regime that governed my gender transition is the South Australian law, where it has been legal since 2017 to obtain the equivalent recognition without surgery or hormones. I went through more or less the exact process Rowling fears is too lenient and too kind to trans women, and I can attest that it was a massively painful experience. Am I the menace she fears? If so, how could I ever convince her that I am not? Or if it is not me that she fears, what does Rowling consider the threat here to be?</p>
<p>Around and around the thought goes through my mind. Perhaps it is not trans women per se that Rowling is concerned about. Rather, perhaps her concern is that malicious men might take advantage of permissive laws and use it to abuse women? The fear of violent men is a fear I can understand! The only thing is, I can’t work out how making gender transition easier for us does anything at all to make the threat posed by violent men any worse than it already is. There are no guards at the bathroom doors. There is nothing barring a man entering. If an abuser wanted to follow me in to the women’s room, I could not stop him. He doesn’t need to identify as anything in particular, he can walk right in. In my experience, the kind of man who intends to physically assault me is not the kind of man who pays a lot of attention to the signage.</p>
<p>Around it goes again. This scenario is absurd, I think. Perhaps this is not what Rowling means. She must mean something else. Perhaps she means that a malicious but nonviolent man might claim to be a trans woman, enter the women’s bathroom and do… something? She doesn’t quite make clear what she fears, but perhaps we don’t need the details spelled out. It’s not hard to come up with possibilities, I suppose, and some of them feel scary. But again, I come back to my confusion… what does this have to do with transgender rights? Suppose we decided to legally require everyone to use the bathroom corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. I would use the men’s room (which I can guarantee will be very disconcerting to everyone), and transgender men would use the women’s room. Okay, I wonder, has Rowling ever met transgender men? I know quite a few, and most of them pass very very well. So if transgender men are required to use the women’s bathroom, it opens women up to an even easier malicious attack by cisgender men: walk into the women’s bathroom and brazenly claim to be a transgender man. The proposed solution is <em>much</em> more dangerous for women, so this can’t be what Rowling means either.</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> she mean?</p>
<p>I’ve thought about this over and over, and I cannot fathom what possible threat she might be afraid of such that <em>“making transition harder for trans women”</em> is a sensible solution. I fear I am going mad. Maybe the answer is staring me in the face. Maybe I <em>am</em> the transgender menace Rowling fears, at least according to one of my scenarios. I don’t think I am that person, but if I were, would I even know? My thoughts return to my ex-boyfriend…</p>

<p>Reflecting on Rowling’s essay, I think a lot about how easy it is to write something in a way that carefully guides the reader to an unreasonable conclusion. My ex-lover gave me a masterclass in this all those years ago. I’ve even done it here. Throughout this essay I’ve talked about the things that my ex wrote about me, and I’ve talked about my experiences with sexual violence. It’s tempting to conclude they must be related, and that the ex-boyfriend was my rapist. That’s utterly and completely untrue. My rapist was a cisgender woman. It had nothing to do with him whatsoever.</p>
<p>He never once laid a hand on me.</p>
