<p>Sometime in April 2018, about two years into gender transition and slightly before I started hormones, I decided to join twitter. I’d been sitting on my handle for a number of years (since 2010 apparently!), but had never felt comfortable enough with social media to start using it. To my own bemusement my account has become rather popular, and last night I noticed that I just passed twelve thousand followers. It started me thinking a little about my experiences on twitter, so I went looking for some “how to twitter” guides aimed at academics. There’s quite a few out there, but one I’ve seen mentioned a lot is <a href="https://t4scientists.com">Twitter for Scientists</a> by Dan Quintana. It’s freely available, well-written, and while I might quibble with some things here and there it’s generally good advice. If you’re looking for a practical guide to the mechanics of twitter and some typical strategies to attract an audience, I’d recommend it.</p>
<p>There is, however, one major weakness in the book: the chapter on <a href="https://t4scientists.com/care.html">self-care</a> is painfully inadequate. It talks briefly about the mechanics of muting and blocking, reporting tweets, and gives the sensible advice to log off if you’re overdoing it (a failing of which I am often guilty!) These are all good things to know about, and is probably all you need to know if you’re not the kind of person who tends to attract harassment. Having spent the last two years on twitter as an openly transgender woman who has actual <em>opinions of her own</em> I can attest to the fact that there is a lot more one needs to know if you hope to avoid abuse. So with that in mind I thought I’d write something of my own. I can’t claim special expertise or authority to speak to the subject though: it’s just an account of experiences I’ve had, mistakes I’ve made, and lessons I’ve learned from them. Consider it supplementary reading, perhaps.</p>
<div id="be-yourself-but-walk-on-eggshells" class="section level2">
<h2>Be yourself, but walk on eggshells</h2>
<p>To motivate this it’s worth taking a moment to consider the advice in Twitter for Scientists about finding your own voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be yourself. Trying to be someone you’re not on Twitter is not sustainable in the long run. Another aspect to consider is how “professional” you want your Twitter account to be. Some people think that you shouldn’t tweet anything you wouldn’t say in front of a live audience of your peers. I understand this sentiment, and realize that different fields have different conventions. But at the same time, you also need to think about the context of Twitter, which is typically more casual than doing an academic talk. Just keep in mind that anyone can search through your tweets, if they want. Finally, some institutions have a social media policy, so it’s best to check if your institution has one before you start tweeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is accurate, I think, but only up to a point. The problem with generic advice to “be yourself” is that if you are (say) a transgender woman, there are a lot of people who despise you for who and what you are, and yes that will include some of your professional academic colleagues. During my time on twitter I’ve found myself being targeted by academic TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), by conservative men who perceive transgender rights to be a convenient wedge issue, and good old fashioned trolls. In most cases this harassment occurred precisely <em>because</em> I made the mistake of speaking too directly about transgender topics, and doing so with my own unguarded voice. I … try not to do that any more, and what I’ve learned from this is that it is <em>not</em> a good idea to “be yourself” without taking some precautions first.</p>
<p>Some of these are things I didn’t have to worry about until my account became popular, while others are things that I had to deal with from the moment I started tweeting. But I do think these are all issues that most of us can’t avoid thinking about at some stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="minimising-the-target" class="section level2">
<h2>Minimising the target</h2>
<p>There are a few “general purpose strategies” that I do nowadays in an attempt to minimise the target for harassment that I present:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable replies.</strong> Twitter is currently rolling out a feature where you can prevent people replying to your tweets. Nowadays, if I have something I want to say about transgender topics that I suspect might attract trolls, I will disable all replies. This has two purposes: first it stops random twitter jerks from showing up in my replies, thus minimising the extent to which <em>I</em> have to look at their horrible opinions (which does cause me distress), and also preventing my followers from seeing and potentially replying to those comments (which is sometimes nice but also sometimes leads to more trolling)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turn off notifications.</strong> Under the notifications settings, you can suppress almost all notifications from twitter. In some respects it’s bad to turn off notifications (e.g., perhaps you want to participate in the discussion) but it has the huge advantage of stopping twitter from interrupting your life just to hear that some random dude just called you a dude in a dress or wants to instruct you on how to do Bayes better. Missing out on some of the conversations sucks, but it is the lesser evil sometimes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mute immediately.</strong> Do not give anyone the opportunity to annoy you twice. If someone has shown up on your feed to engage in rape apologia or just wants to “have a conversation” about what bathrooms you can use, mute immediately and never look back. If you see someone doing it in another thread, mute them preemptively because you’ll probably encounter them again later. I don’t know how many people I have muted now but it’s definitely in the thousands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consider your blocking policy.</strong> Opinions are divided on when you should block someone. On the one hand there is the “block early block often school” that says you should block at the first sign of trouble, even to the point of suggesting that you use block lists like TERFblocker. It has its advantages, but it’s hard to stop someone evading the block using a dummy account or a private browser. So my own approach now is to treat blocking as a method of last resort. I only have three people blocked these days. Regardless of what approach you take, it is always your prerogative to block whomsoever you like for whatever reason you like.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use private mode strategically.</strong> As a general rule, I don’t think that it helps much to make your account private. However, there are some exceptions. If you get harassed by someone with a very large twitter following, I think it helps to lock your account immediately. It won’t stop people saying horrible things about you elsewhere, and it won’t do anything to prevent your tweets from being seen/screenshotted/shared by trolls with dummy accounts, but it’s still useful. If the person harassing you has tens of thousands of followers, only a few of them are likely to have heard of you before so if you lock your account quickly they can’t flood your thread</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Close your DMs.</strong> I usually keep my DMs closed, and only people I follow can message me. I grew tired of people sending me random messages demanding that I debate the terms of my existence with them. I do open them from time to time, but not often anymore. Besides, twitter DMs make a terrible inbox!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think before you speak up.</strong> I hate saying this but it is often unwise to speak up. Pointing out harassment is very likely to attract more harassment. Appealing to your colleagues for support is also unlikely to be helpful, at least in my experience. By and large academics are more transphobic than they believe themselves to be, and even if they are not they will tend to be pretty clueless. They probably won’t know how to spot anti-trans harassment and even if they do they’ll probably be too timid/politically-cautious to speak in your defence. This is not to say that I never speak my mind or never speak up, but I have started to do better at picking my battles and keeping my expectations low. Often I find myself stuck in a double bind where my choices are to pretend I did not see an offensive comment (and to be hurt by it in private) or to speak up about it and have my concerns ignored (and to be hurt more publicly). Some battles can’t be won, and it’s best not to engage when you are stuck in that frustrating situation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="some-trans-specific-thoughts" class="section level2">
<h2>Some trans-specific thoughts</h2>
<p>In addition to these there are a few things that are perhaps a little more specific to my experience of being a trans woman on twitter:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use the tools you have.</strong> If you are a trans woman and you don’t have browser extensions helping you navigate twitter then you are probably missing out on one of the most useful survival tools. I cannot count the number of times when an anti-trans account has shown up on my feed and browser extensions have saved me from accidentally engaging with hostile people.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn the dogwhistles.</strong> I feel stupid saying it because honestly is there any trans woman on twitter who can’t spot a TERF a mile away? But if not, anyone with “adult human female”, “GC”, “gender critical” or “genderfree” in their bio is probably hostile to you and worth blocking/muting premptively. Anyone who has a pronoun joke in their bio should probably be muted on sight. If you see anyone using acronyms like “TRA”, “TIM”, “MTT” or “FTT” you might as well save yourself the trouble and block/mute in advance. There is no chance whatsoever that such a person has any interest in meaningful interaction with you, and the only thing you’ll get from them is harassment. And for the love of all that is sacred in this world, if you have not already done so mute/block JK Rowling now. Sheesh.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assume they can see you.</strong> One of the most instructive moments I’ve had on twitter came early in 2019 when I didn’t have all that many followers, and I made a grumpy comment about Jesse Singal. I didn’t think much of it. I knew of him mostly because of his journalism on transgender subjects, and like most trans people I’m not a fan. What I didn’t realise is that a lot of social psychologists think he’s a decent human being and my tweet was called to his attention courtesy of someone screenshotting my tweet. This led to him tweeting some mildy unpleasant things about me, and – as is their wont – his followers got themselves more than a little incensed. I got through it largely unscathed thankfully (because by that time I’d learned the lesson of account-locking) but it was instructive: academic twitter is not isolated from the rest of twitter and it can quickly bleed into other, much uglier territory. It only takes one tweet for bad things to happen, and after having things like that happen to me a few times I realised that there is a lesson here. Don’t assume that your account is “too small” to be noticed by people you’d prefer to avoid, and don’t assume that you are safe simply because you’re on “academic twitter”. That’s not how it works.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stop reading the hate sites</strong>. It is probably an inevitability that as a transgender persion you’ll end up reading mumsnet, spinster, r/gendercritical (before reddit banned it anyway), kiwifarms etc and through those forums discover some horrible people on twitter. I won’t say that it’s completely fruitless as an activity: I learned a lot about their tactics and about what kind of tweets tend to attract their attention just by reading the kinds of things they’d post there. But there’s a limit to how much you can gain from that, and I strongly recommend quitting the habit. My twitter life has been a lot better ever since I stopped bothering with those people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reading all this does make it seem terribly dramatic, but it’s not as bad as all that. My experience was that it took me about a year to learn all these rules, and quite a bit longer to implement them. I still fail to take my own advice more than I care to admit. But the more I am able to “stick to the plan” the easier I find it to survive on twitter.</p>
</div>
<div id="your-community-is-who-you-want-it-to-be" class="section level2">
<h2>Your community is who you want it to be</h2>
<p>Looking back, I think there’s one last lesson I’ve learned. When I first joined twitter I kind of assumed that since I’m an academic and my work focuses a lot on statistical and scientific inferences, I would find a home in the open science community. On the surface it seems like an obvious home, but in practice I found engaging with that community to be the source of my worst and most toxic experiences on twitter. There are a variety of reasons why it worked out that way for me – and of course it might be a perfectly good place for other people – but having come to that conclusion it’s helped me a lot to step away. I still post preprints relevant to that field, and if people in that community want to talk about them, great! But I don’t feel any obligation to socialise with people in that crowd or to engage in debate. It might be my field, but they aren’t my community.</p>
<p>What I’ve found instead is that I have a natural home in the R community. I share code, packages, artwork, and occasionally papers there. There are people in that community I consider friends. Because I feel welcome there I find it a lot easier to tweet about things I care about in that context, where I might not do so in other contexts. It makes me a lot happier engaging with twitter that way, and honestly I am too old and too grumpy to be bothered with social media if I don’t enjoy it. I’ll hang out with people I like and tweet things that I like. That tends to work better for me than anything else I’ve tried.</p>
