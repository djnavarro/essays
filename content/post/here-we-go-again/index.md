> The function, the very serious function of racism, is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language, so you spend twenty years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn't shaped properly, so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Someone says you have no art, so you dredge that up. Somebody says you have no kingdoms, so you dredge that up. None of that is necessary.

> When people talk about 'are trans women women?', my feeling is 'trans women are trans women'. If you've lived in the world as a man with the privileges the world accords to men and then switch gender, it's difficult for me to accept that we can equate your experience with the experience of a woman who has lived from the beginning in the world as a woman and who has not been accorded those privileges that men are <br> -- [Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie, 2017](https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/3/15/14910900/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-transgender-women-comments-apology)

Since transitioning, one of the most utterly tiresome discussions I have found myself dragged into is the question of male privilege as it relates to the lives and experiences of trans women. Over and over again it comes up, and over and over I have to waste my limited time and emotional resources trying to explain to cisgender people that their intuitions about transgender women are wrong. This effort is wasted in at least three senses. First, because *every* cisgender person asks the same tiresome questions under the mistaken impression they have valuable insights to offer me, I have to repeat my answers over and over. Second, it is a wasted effort because this is not how I want to spend my life: there are so many things in this world that I love, and this is not one of them. Third, and perhaps most depressing, the effort is a waste because it doesn't matter what I say: cisgender people will believe whatever *they* want to believe about trans women, irrespective of what we say. It was a waste of time when I wrote about [transgender rights](/post/an-ordinary-account). It was a waste of time when I wrote about [whether trans women are women](post/trans-women-are/). It was a waste of time when I wrote about [my transition](post/in-between/), [my fears](post/gender-critical-fear/), [my rape](post/something-improbable-happened/), and it was absolutely a waste of my time when I wrote about what it is like to be a [trans woman in academia](post/52-pickup/). So I write this in full knowledge that I am wasting my time, but here I am again, writing. I write because I can't get it out of my head if I do not write. In the end I am writing this not for the benefit of the cisgender people who will inevitably ignore me, but for myself and for my trans sisters who are as frustrated as I am with this absurdity.
