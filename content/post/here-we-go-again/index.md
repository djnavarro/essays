> The function, the very serious function of racism, is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language, so you spend twenty years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn't shaped properly, so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Someone says you have no art, so you dredge that up. Somebody says you have no kingdoms, so you dredge that up. None of that is necessary.

Since transitioning, one of the most utterly tiresome discussions I have found myself dragged into is the question of male privilege as it relates to the lives and experiences of trans women. Over and over again it comes up, and over and over I have to waste my limited time and emotional resources trying to explain to cisgender people that their intuitions about transgender women are wrong. This effort is wasted in at least three senses. First, because *every* cisgender person asks the same tiresome questions under the mistaken impression they have valuable insights to offer me, I have to repeat my answers over and over. Second, it is a wasted effort because this is not how I want to spend my life: there are so many things in this world that I love, and this is not one of them. Third, and perhaps most depressing, the effort is a waste because it doesn't matter what I say: cisgender people will believe whatever *they* want to believe about trans women, irrespective of what we say. It was a waste of time when I wrote about [transgender rights](/post/an-ordinary-account). It was a waste of time when I wrote about [whether trans women are women](post/trans-women-are/). It was a waste of time when I wrote about [my transition](post/in-between/), [my fears](post/gender-critical-fear/), [my rape](post/something-improbable-happened/), and it was absolutely a waste of my time when I wrote about what it is like to be a [trans woman in academia](post/52-pickup/). So I write this in full knowledge that I am wasting my time, but here I am again, writing. I write because I can't get it out of my head if I do not write. In the end I am writing this not for the benefit of the cisgender people who will inevitably ignore me, but for myself and for my trans sisters who are as frustrated as I am with this absurdity.

The quote from Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie at the top of the post has annoyed me for a long time. What annoys me about it is not merely that she is wrong, but that she had the presumption to think she is an authority on the subject of trans women and our lives. She is no more an expert on how trans women live and what we experience than I am an expert on the life of cisgender women in Nigeria. Had I been interviewed by the BBC and were asked to comment on the lives of Nigerian women, the correct answer would be "I think this is a question you should ask a Nigerian woman, not me." This is how Adichie *should* have responded when asked about the lives of trans women. Unfortunately, she did not. Rather, the presumed that her opinion was relevant, that her knowledge of the subject was sufficient to justify her offering an answer. The question of whether (or in which respects) trans women receive male privilege was not hers to answer, and she should have known that.

The difficulty facing any trans woman who makes this point -- that we are better placed to comment on our lives than cisgender feminists -- is that in doing so, an expectation is invoked that she will now provide the desired explanation. She falls into precisely the trap that Toni Morrison lays out: she must divert her energy from living her own life as best she can to dealing with whatever foolishness happens to have captured the attention of cisgender people. But what else can I do? This absurdity is stuck in my head and I won't be able to return to my life until I deal with it. So, with an exasperated sigh, I tell myself to get started. *Here we go again...*

Any time the subject of male privilege arises, there is a certain amount of ambiguity that needs to be resolved at the beginning. What precisely do we mean when we refer to male privilege? Usually we mean something along the lines of this: "male privilege refers to a collection of advantages and benefits that society typically provides to men, but women are typically denied". It seems like a reasonable working definition, but the word "*typically*" is doing a lot of work in this sentence. Not every man receives every male privilege. Not every woman is denied every male privilege. The term "male privilege" picks out a statistical pattern in our social world; it does not describe any absolute rules. Consider, for instance, the privilege of being permitted to express anger. Soraya Chemaly makes a compelling case in [*Rage Becomes Her*](http://ragebecomesher.com/) that women are systematically denied access to expressions of anger; anger to which men are entitled as a kind of birthright. As a statistical pattern I think Chemaly's claim is entirely accurate but, as she points out at the very beginning of the book, there are systematic exceptions:

> in some cultures anger is a way to vent frustration, but in others it is more for exerting authority. In the United States, anger in white men is often portrayed as justifiable and patriotic, but in black men, as criminality; and in black women, as threat.

In other words, while the entitlement to anger could indeed be labelled a male privilege, it would be wrong to claim that Black men and white men have equal access to this privilege. Showing anger is a risk for Black men in the United States in a way that white men rarely experience. To state the obvious intersectional point: racism and gender interact here in a way that means we should take care in generalising from white men to Black men. In fact, as Ruby Hamad documents at some length in [*White Tears/Brown Scars*](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/white-tears-brown-scars-ruby-hamad/1136287515) there is a long history of white women being complicit in racism in ways that are actively harmful to people of colour. All of which is to make the obvious point that a narrow focus on "male privilege" is unwise in any situation where race is also a factor. This point is generally uncontested in feminist thinking nowadays, even among white writers, and so what surprises me most about Adichie's comment about trans women and male privilege is that there is *no* comparable recognition that it makes no sense whatsoever to generalise from cisgender men to transgender women. Trans women are not a random or representative subset of male-assigned people: literally *no-one* believes that, not even the bigots who despise us and would seek to have us eradicated. Our lives are systematically different from theirs *before* transition as well as after, and my claim here -- which I am astounded that I have to keep making -- is that our lives and ostensible privileges need to be understood on our own terms. This is the fundamental error that I see cisgender writers make over and over again when they try to "reason from first principles" about what trans women experience. To my mind, the fact that even someone as insightful and talented as Adichie makes this very basic reasoning error is revealing.
