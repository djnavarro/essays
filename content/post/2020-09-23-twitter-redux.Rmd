I have made a decision to change how I use twitter: for all the professional and personal benefits I've received from being on twitter, it has come at an immense personal cost. Twitter poses a real threat to my mental health, one I need to take seriously. Looking at it from a simple costs/benefits perspective:

### Benefits

- Posting art is inherently rewarding
- Interacting with R community is inherently rewarding
- It is where my friends are, and staying in touch is important to me
- I learn a lot of programming/art from twitter
- There are a lot of professional opportunities on twitter
- The ability to publicise projects, events etc is unparalleled
- Asserts my right to exist in public space (a personal matter)

### Costs

- Emotional demands are intense (especially given my situation/temperament)
- Context collapse is so severe that some subjects are impossible
- Twitter can absorb a lot of my time in unproductive ways 
- Political content induces hard-to-control emotional responses 
- Visibility as trans woman means proximity to anti-trans activists
- Academic twitter is viciously combative, and is a real threat to my mental health

There are substantial benefits but also large costs. What makes it difficult is that -- paraphrasing Stannis Baratheon -- the good does not wash away the bad, nor the bad the good. There is no moral or emotional calculus that I can articulate that would allow these things to be placed on a common scale, no simple way of weighing one against the other. Nevertheless, it seems to me that I can be on twitter *only* if I have a viable plan to reduce or eliminate these costs, even if that comes at the expense of losing some of the benefits. With that in mind...


### Instructions to my future self

There are a handful of very strict rules to abide by. If you can't adhere to these at a bare minimum you need to quit twitter forever. 

0. **Always check this list before tweeting.**
1. No politics of **any** kind. This includes academic politics, culture wars, anything to do with trans rights. Yes you have political beliefs; you don't need to discuss them on twitter, and it is usually harmful to me when you do.
2. No academic talk about emotionally charged subjects. That includes open science, preregistration, and the logic of scientific inference. Discussion of these subjects on twitter is not possible: it has become a culture war in itself and accordingly, forbidden under rule 1.
3. Never tweet from negative emotion. Context collapse leads to emotional magnification on twitter, and that is particularly dangerous for you given the nature of your emotions. If you have even the slightest doubt about it, you do not post. Yes, that means **you** sweetie, right now. You can come back here tomorrow if you must. 
4. Limit tweets from positive emotion. Positive emotions are fine, but be wary of how the cascade works.
5. Enforce your time boundaries. Your "strictly managed login" method works as long as you adhere to the preceding rules during login, and it is the only thing that has. This strategy must stay in place. The upper bound on login is an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening. More than that and you risk cascade.
6. The unspoken rule.
