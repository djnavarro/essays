<p>I found the dates in my calendar. November 26th 2018 was the day when I a lawyer at the <a href="https://www.iclc.org.au/">Inner City Legal Centre</a> helped me put together the paperwork for my application to update the gender marker on my birth certificate. I’d been out for maybe a year? It’s hard to work out how to give a precise date for “coming out”, but if forced to pick one I’d have to choose the work Christmas party on 20th December 2017. I started hormones on 10th April 2018. The birth certificate was issued on 12th December 2018. Since that point I have been a “recognised transgender person” under the law and for the first time was entitled to some degree of protection under the law.</p>
<p>Today is May 31st, 2020. It’s been a strange year so far. Early in the year massive bushfires engulfed large parts of New South Wales and Victoria, on a scale I’ve never seen in my life. At one point there were eight separate fires burning that were individually bigger than the largest bushfire in US history. We were barely recovering from that catstrophe when the global coronavirus pandemic hit. At this point it has infected 6 million people worldwide and killed 370,000. Perhaps by luck, perhaps by good planning and response Australia has been spared the worst of it, with just over 7000 cases and 103 deaths so far. Even here the borders are all closed, we have had strict nationwide lockdowns since mid-March. Restrictions are very slowly being eased, but authorities are rightly wary.</p>
<p>I’m lying in my bed doomscrolling on twitter. Right now there are riots taking place across dozens of cities in the United States sparked by the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Yet despite the protests internationally is very peaceful here in Sydney’s inner west. A quiet Sunday afternoon in Newtown.</p>
<p>My therapist is concerned about me. The last three appointments I have been flat, irritable and fatalistic about life. The thoughts of self harm and suicide that have plagued me since I was 15 or so have been intense for the last month and they’re starting to wear me down. Personally I think he’s being overly dramatic, but it’s certainly true that things are bad. Sure there are reasons – good reasons, I think – for why I have been doing poorly of late, but that doesn’t make it any easier to cope. I’m not sleeping well, and I feel like I’m fraying at the edges. On twitter I’ve been running into more of the “gender critical feminists”. Mostly I’m ignoring them. Instead I’m <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net">making art</a> to help keep myself from falling apart. It helps, a little.</p>
<p>My thoughts have returned to November 26 2018. Sitting on a bench on Darlinghurst road. Waiting anxiously for my appointment with the lawyer, reading the plaques embedded in the footpath commemorating the place that Kings Cross has played in LGBTIQ history and as the traditional red light district in Sydney. My thoughts have returned to January 25 2020, walking through the Compton Transgender District in the Tenderloin in San Francisco, reading the plaques in the sidwalk commemorating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton%27s_Cafeteria_riot">Compton’s Cafeteria Riot</a> in 1966, the first major LGBTIQ riot in United States history. Walking through the Tenderloin as a white middle class Australian is a reminder of how stark the inequalities and injustices in American society are. Right next to the fancy hotel I was staying in for my fancy tech conference I was being paid to attend is a tent city where a large homeless population lives. It goes without saying that very few of the homeless in the Tenderloin are white.</p>

<p>It is eight hours later and I am disoriented. I remember that I was exhausted, I was writing the text above, and my panic started to rise. I took a valium tablet out of desperation. It was the first time I’ve needed to do that in weeks. I passed out and now I don’t quite recall what I wanted to say with this.</p>
